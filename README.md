# YOLOv5-Custom-Training
This repository contains instructions and code for training the YOLOv5 object detection model on custom data for car detection. YOLOv5 is a popular and efficient deep learning model for real-time object detection, and customizing it to detect cars in your own datasets can be a valuable asset for various applications. Please browse the YOLOv5 [Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/) for details.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

Python: You need Python 3.6 or later. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Git: If you haven't already, install Git by following the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

NVIDIA GPU (optional): Training YOLOv5 is significantly faster on a GPU. If you have access to an NVIDIA GPU, make sure you have installed the [NVIDIA CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) for GPU support.
Or you can use Free GPU resources like [Google Colab](https://colab.google/).
